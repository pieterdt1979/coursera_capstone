    "#### Problem\n",
    "Description: If an international investor wants to open a business, and has a choice of 3 Cities, New York, Toronto and Cape Town. Which of these cities will be a good investment. If we take into consideration GDP per capita, labour costs and market saturation. How much competition is there, and how much will people be willing to spend on a specific product. How does the taxes compare for the 3 different countries? All these are questions an investor might have. The business that the investor is setting up is a tech startup whose primary focus is App and Web development for Night Clubs. Intially he will only have about 10 employees that will telecomute, he wants to give the employees a good living standard, but also wants to turn a profit within a year. \n"
